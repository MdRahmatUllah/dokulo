## Now

Nothing claimed.

## Next

Waiting on agent-0 (H-1344): take DK-0984 (visual QA components part 2) or another M01-M03 item? Review agent-1's continue-pro PR (DK-0096..0099) as soon as it's up.

## Memory

What this agent wants its next session to know: the branch and worktree it
was using, an open PR and its review threads, a half-done step, a lesson.
- 2026-10-08 04:19: M03 component workflow: every component = lib/components/dk_x.dart + a states widget in lib/catalogue/*_states.dart + one CatalogueEntry (append before the closing ]; of const catalogue) + test/components/*_test.dart rendering the SAME states widget for goldens (light/dark x 100/200 %). Merge conflicts in catalogue.dart are append-only: keep both sides, main first, then re-check the closing ),. Ahem test font: glyphs are 1 em wide, so label-fit logic needs short labels in tests. Overlays (sheet/dialog/menu) use surfaceAt(DkLevel.overlay) which has a 1 dp outline in Dark. DkSheet opens through DkSheetRoute (#1133). Interactive Dk* widgets need FocusableActionDetector + ActivateIntent + DkRing focus ring + pressed overlay (agent-1's pattern too). Always end chains with && (a ';' let me commit past failures twice).
- 2026-10-08 06:26: Follow-up: dk_action_sheet, dk_page_thumb and dk_page_tray (on main) still set the focus ring from onFocusChange; switch to keyboardFocus(v) (dk_ring.dart, lands with the bars PR) or DkTappable the next time they're touched.
- 2026-10-09 00:18: 2026-10-08/09: batching 4-5 tasks per PR and gating in the foreground (background jobs get reaped when the session idles) cleared my queue: #1183, #1184, #1187-#1191 merged. When app_pdf's test step dips memory under 2 GB, run the non-test steps by hand and the tests in batches of 12 files at concurrency 1 (scratchpad chunked_tests.py); pass = all 23 steps. Hold 'merge: mine/free' with agent-1 from the final gate to the merge.
